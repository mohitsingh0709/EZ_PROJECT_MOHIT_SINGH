Secure File Sharing System
<hr>
Backend Engineering Assessment ‚Äì EZ Works
This project is a secure file sharing platform built as part of the backend developer assessment for EZ Works.
You can view the live instance here: TODO (Note: This deployment will be removed post-assessment).

It features a REST API that enables secure file upload, download, and management for two distinct user roles: Operation Users and Client Users.

<hr>
üîß Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Flask (Python)

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

File Validation: python-magic
Detects file types based on content rather than file extensions alone.

<hr>
üîê Security Measures
Files are validated by examining their actual content, not just the extension.

Download URLs are encrypted and expire shortly after generation.

Passwords are hashed before being saved to the database.

üìå API Overview
üîë Authentication
